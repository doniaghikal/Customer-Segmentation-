# Customer-Segmentation-
🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation 

📌 Project Overview

This notebook explores customer segmentation using mall customer data. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on demographic and behavioral features, enabling targeted marketing strategies and improved customer experience.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset typically includes the following columns:

• `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
• `Gender`: Male or Female
• `Age`: Age of the customer
• `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income in thousands
• `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature


🧠 Objectives

• Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer distribution
• Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers
• Visualize clusters to interpret customer groups
• Evaluate the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score


🛠️ Technologies Used

• Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
• Jupyter Notebook


📈 Key Steps

1. Data Loading & Cleaning: Import dataset and handle missing values if any
2. EDA: Visualize distributions, correlations, and feature relationships
3. Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for clustering
4. Clustering: Apply K-Means or other clustering algorithms
5. Evaluation: Use metrics and plots to assess cluster quality
6. Visualization: Plot clusters in 2D or 3D for interpretation


📌 Results Summary

• Number of clusters identified: e.g., 5
• Characteristics of each cluster: e.g., high-income low-spending, young high-spending, etc.
• Business insights: e.g., target promotions to high-spending clusters
